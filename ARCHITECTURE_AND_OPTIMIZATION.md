# PureFFT: A Novel Frequency Domain Neural Architecture

## Architectural Overview

### Core Concept
PureFFT represents a radical departure from traditional neural networks by operating entirely in the frequency domain. Unlike conventional architectures that process spatial or temporal data directly, PureFFT leverages Fourier space for pattern matching and transformation.

### Key Components

#### 1. Pattern Pool
```python
self.pattern_pool = Tensor.cos(2 * math.pi * i * t / n_patterns) * 0.02
```
- Represents fundamental frequency components
- Generated using cosine basis functions
- Each pattern captures different frequency characteristics
- Small scaling factor (0.02) prevents pattern dominance

#### 2. Layer Patterns
```python
self.layer_patterns = Tensor.cos(2 * math.pi * i * t / n_layers) * 0.02
```
- Layer-specific frequency selectors
- Enable hierarchical pattern transformation
- Share same frequency space as pattern pool
- Reusable across all input samples

#### 3. Class Patterns
```python
self.class_patterns = Tensor.cos(2 * math.pi * i * t / 10) * 0.02
```
- Class-specific frequency signatures
- Direct mapping from frequency space to classes
- No need for complex classification heads

### Forward Pass Analysis

#### Pattern Selection Stage
```python
pattern_scores = (self.pattern_pool * self.layer_patterns[i].reshape(1, -1)).sum(axis=1)
pattern_weights = pattern_scores.softmax()
```
- Element-wise correlation in frequency domain
- Automatic pattern importance weighting
- No attention matrices or key-query computations
- Pure frequency-based selection

#### Pattern Application Stage
```python
weighted_patterns = (self.pattern_pool * pattern_weights.reshape(-1, 1))
x = (x.reshape(x.shape[0], 1, -1) * weighted_patterns.reshape(1, -1, self.freq_dim)).sum(axis=1)
```
- Direct pattern application through multiplication
- Maintains frequency domain interpretation
- Efficient weighted combination

#### Classification Stage
```python
class_scores = (x.reshape(x.shape[0], 1, -1) * self.class_patterns.reshape(1, 10, -1)).sum(axis=2)
```
- Pure frequency domain classification
- No dense layers or complex projections
- Direct pattern matching with class signatures

## Conclusion

PureFFT represents a novel approach to neural computation that combines the elegance of frequency domain operations with highly efficient GPU-friendly computations. Its unique architecture offers numerous opportunities for optimization while maintaining mathematical purity and interpretability.

The absence of traditional neural network components like matrix multiplications and feed-forward layers not only simplifies the architecture but also opens up unique optimization paths that aren't available to conventional networks. The focus on element-wise operations and reusable patterns aligns particularly well with modern GPU architectures.
